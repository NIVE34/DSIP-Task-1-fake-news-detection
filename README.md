This maintains lie about a certain statistic in a country or exaggerated cost of certain services for a country, which may arise unrest for  some countries. There are organizations trying to deal with issues as confirming authors are accountable. However, their scope is so limited because they depend on human manual detection, in a globe with millions of articles
